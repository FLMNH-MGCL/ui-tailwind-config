# @flmnh-mgcl/ui-tailwind-config

This is the tailwind config used in the [UI](https://github.com/FLMNH-MGCL/ui) library developed for [spesql](https://github.com/FLMNH-MGCL/spesql), now installable as a separate plugin. Please refer to the [UI](https://github.com/FLMNH-MGCL/ui#README.md) homepage for installation / usage. However it may be used separately, as it is just a collection of custom tailwind classes.
